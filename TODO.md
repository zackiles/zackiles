# TODO

- Github Action. Pull in recent stats daily
- Go outside and enjoy some fresh air? Why am I on Github, why are you here reading thins. You should git some fresh air as well

## Generate Dynamic Stats for README.md

The README.md shows on my Github profile. Include wild stats like the below for the fun:

**GitHub Metrics List**

1. **Semantic Commit Spectrum**
   Analyze the verbs in your commit messages (e.g. _add_, _fix_, _remove_, _refactor_) to classify your coding behavior. Reveals whether you're more of a creator, maintainer, cleaner, or experimenter.

2. **File Type Footprint**
   Tracks the distribution of file extensions (`.ts`, `.json`, `.md`, etc.) you've committed to. Offers a view into your technical stack, tooling ecosystem, and roles (e.g. full-stack vs. infra-heavy).

3. **Code Velocity Delta**
   Compares the total number of lines added/removed over the past 30 days versus the same period a year ago. Highlights momentum shifts, burnout risk, or growth phases in your development rhythm.

4. **Creator Tag Signature**
   Lists the most common GitHub topics/tags across repos you’ve personally created. Represents your primary domains of authority and project identity.

5. **Starred Topic Affinity**
   Aggregates the most frequent tags of repos you’ve starred. Indicates aspirational learning areas, personal interests, and curiosity zones.

6. **Star Power Picks**
   Highlights the most popular repos you've starred, sorted by their total GitHub star count. Measures alignment with mainstream open-source trends and influential ecosystems.

7. **Niche Scout Score**
   Compares the median star count of all repos you’ve starred against the global median. A lower score implies you're discovering under-the-radar projects before they go viral; a higher one suggests a preference for established projects.
